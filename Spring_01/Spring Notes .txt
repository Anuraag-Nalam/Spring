Dependency Injection
Bean
Spring Context

Launch Spring Context and make it to manage the property name
Things which are managed by Spring are called as spring beans (managed inside the context). we can define the methods for the spring to manage these beans.Bean can be imagined as an annotation to methods which will return new objects when they are called using the spring context. 

Contept understood - How the beans are being managed by the spring framework

What is spring container
Manages spring beans and their life cycle
Container, Context, Spring IOC Container - same thing
It takes classes as the inputs and creates a running system

POJO vs Java Bean vs Spring Bean
When a class implements Serializable, and when a class have getters and setters and also, then it is EJB (Enterprise Java Bean)

@Primary Annotation - to avoid clashes when we use type on the class while accessing the beans
@Qualifier-Annotation used to autowire other beans as parameters when there is a name clash. We can configure specially for the beans 

methods with same qualifier names is not causing any issue
